# Proof of Mentorship

This project combines a browser-based frontend to allow community members to find potential mentors within the community based on specific skills they are interested in improving. 

The platform is gated by a dynamic NFT the member will use to proof their membership to the community. 

First, the member will receive a code from the admins to be able to mint their dynamic POMP NFT. The POMP NFT is minted with blank metadata which will then be customized by the owner based on their current skills and openness to mentor other community members. 
Second, the member can customize the skills they have based on a preset list shared by the community admins with POMP. These skills will appear as unverified initially, until a member vouches the other person has them after a 1:1 session. The skills will be verified through the interactions new members have with each other. 

Third, Members looking for a mentor are set to go! 
By using the Graph, we will index the metadata from the dynamic NFTs and enable users to filter through other members profiles based on the skills they are looking to be mentored on and on the willingness of others to be mentors. Potential mentors who meet the selected criteria will be displayed to the user along with the complete set of skills linked to that NFT.

Fourth, Connect! 
The member can choose a mentor from the selection displayed and set up a 1:1 video/voice mentorship session with them. The interest of mentorship will be recorded. During the session, both members will be asked to record the session, this will allow them to come back and review if needed, but will also enable them to rate the mentorship they gave/received and the skills the person they interacted with has. 

Five: Rate! 

After completing the session, members will be asked to upload their recordings to Livepeer, which will mint them a Proof of Mentorship NFT, signaling they have completed the session they had signed up for. The more mentorships people give/receive, the more POMs theyâ€™ll receive to validate their skills and contributions to the community. These POMs will also enable them to rate the mentorship they had in a private way using Semaphore to avoid retaliation in case the feedback is negative. The POMPs minted after the mentorship will recognize these two members a part of a group an enable the rating of the interaction in a private form. 

Six: Grow

Members skills and rating will be updated in the NFT following 5 interactions, to ensure the privacy of the raters. Ratings will be encrypted when aggregated and then pushed at one time. Help your community develop and gain recognition in your community!
